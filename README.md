# Smart-fliament-spool-holder
Filament holder that provides filament tangle and run-out detection, plus ball bearing spool guide. 

1. 3D printed spool holder is the crossbred of [this smart spool holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3383638) and 
[this ballbearing filament holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3020026). The smart spool holder doesn't provide CAD
source code, so I imported its STL files into OpenSCAD, and filled holes/added slabs. It's very slow in rendering the 
large RockerArmRemix, due to the imported STL. Increase your OpenSCAD cache memory to alleviate it.

2. You will need OctoPrint and [Filament Sensor Reloaded](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/filament_sensor_reloaded/).
